# HighScore

The text file HighScore.txt stores the players who have scored the top ten scores in a game, in descending order of score. The file stores the 3-character name of the player, and their integer score. 

Example : FYI is the player name
          10000 is the score

# The Program:

Reads data from HighScore.txt
Allows the user to enter a new player name and their score
If appropriate, inserts the new player (name and score) in top ten
Writes the top ten players in a new text file "NewHighScore.txt"
